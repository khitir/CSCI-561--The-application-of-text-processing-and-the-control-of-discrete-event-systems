The purpose of this project is to learn about:

Algorithms for regular language manipulation.

The application of regular languages to: a. text processing, b. the control of discrete event systems.



The code portion of the project is divided into four parts, corresponding to different lecture segments. For each function to complete, the expected total length of the function (starter code plus code you will write) is listed below.

Part 0, Introduction. Complete the following functions:

DFA-SIMULATE, Expected length: about 15 lines
Part 1, Subset construction. Complete the following functions:

E-CLOSURE, Expected length: about 10 lines
MOVE-E-CLOSURE, Expected length: less than 10 lines
NFA->DFA, Expected length: about 30 lines
NFA-SIMULATE, Expected length: about 15 lines
Part 2, Regular Expressions. Complete the following functions:

SIMPLIFY-REGEX, Expected length: about 25 lines
FA-UNION, Expected length: about 20 lines
FA-REPEAT, Expected length: about 15 lines
REGEX->NFA, Expected length: about 30 lines
Part 3, Regular Language Properties, Complete the following functions:

FA-EMPTY, Expected length: about 15 lines
DFA-MINIMIZE, Expected length: about 30 lines
DFA-INTERSECTION, Expected length: about 50 lines
DFA-EQUIVALENT, Expected length: about 10 lines
